# Hitch Hikers Guild to Job Searches

Based on trial and error and reading alot of blogs here are the tips and tricks I found to making it easy for Recruiters and Hiring Managers to find you and relate you to a job they are looking for.

## STEP 1: Pick a job title to focus on

__PICK ONE!__

Go through linked in and find what primary job title you want to apply to.

What you will find is titles like 'Delivery Manager', 'VP of Credit Dervitaves', '<my product> UI Engineer', MD of Structured Products", etc are not industry standard titles. Although these titles will query jobs when resumes are reviewed 'exact matches' make it easier for the ATS & Hiring process to recongnize you resume is a match.

You will find titles like 'Senior Software Developer', 'Solutions Archtiect', 'Engineering Manager' are standard idustry titles


## STEP 2: How to check if your resume will pass ATS?
Test it with tools like Jobscan or Resume Worded to ensure it's ATS-friendly. These checks optimize keyword usage, format, and overall compatibility. Don't overlook this stepâ€”it could make the difference in landing your desired job!J

### I selected jobscan.co(there are others)
Its about $70 for a 3 month subscription, you get 2 free scans to play with it:

## STEP 3: Score your current Resume
Run your Linked Inprofile and resume through it using Job Descriptions you think your a perfect fit for and you will see you score is far off from what you expect.

### Job Title
	Now for the resume, Change the job title at the top of your resuem and similiar jobs to have the exact title char for char in the JD and watch you score jump.

	The key lesson here is you need ot use the job title for the specific job, even if yours is simliar if they have 'Manger, Engineering' and you have 'Engineering Manager' CHANGE IT. Look at my LI profile and see what I did with 'AWS Solutions Architect' and 'Engineering Manager' titles. https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-zucker/

## STEP 4: Create a standard resume, Pick one job and tune it to get a high score like 80%+, some tips on the tool:

### a. Make sure you have 'Core Skills', 'Certifications' sections, add them using the edit feature in the tool

### b. You can simply add hard/soft skills to the skills sections, look for thing you have that are close and rename them

### c. Look through you bullets and reword things using the terms you see that you dont have to increase your score.

### d. now if you click on a skill it will give you recommended bullets

### e. once you are at 75%+ remove your summary and use the tool to auto generate one for you with AI its pretty cool.

## STEP 5: Update you LinkedIn Profile to match the resume, WARNING: Dont publish yet, we will do that when we are all done and share with your network!

### a. Update each section, I know it hurts make the titles standard, you can keep your SVP title but make it SVP <standard Title>

### b. Now pile up the skills on each experience, dupicates are OK dont be shy.

### c. Make sure you have your certs in the certs section, if you dont have any, get some they are VERY Creditable.

## STEP 6: OK Mark yourself 'OPEN FOR WORK'

If you already are set to this turn it off and back on to publish and get the LI profile out there!

## STEP 7: Update your Resume on LI and all the job boards
Note: you can make it searchable to recruiters only and you wont get that 'open for work' banner on your profile picture.

### a. LinkedIn profile has a resume, also make sure you have contact info, email, cell so when you reply to a recruiter Linked can share it with them!

### b. Setup profiles on all of these boards nd make your resume searchable
	LinkedIn
	Glassdoor
	Wellfounded
	theLadders
	CareerBuilder
	eFinancial
	dice
	jobleads

## STEP 8: Apply to 3-5(ideally 10) jobs per day, creating a custom resume using jobscan.

### a. tune the resume to atleast 75%

### b. Dont forget to delete and generate a new summary (i usually update it to add some of the soft/hard skills after AI is done)

### c. After the resume is tunned, checkout the cover letter AI generator its pretty cool
### WARNING: download the resume as a Word doc, suggest you change margins to 'narrow' and in some place like before core skills there are 2 blank lines remove one, try to keep the resume to 3 pages, if I'm able to do it, all of you should be able to.
